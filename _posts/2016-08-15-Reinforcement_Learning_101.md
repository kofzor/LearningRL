## Reinforcement Learning 101 ##

**Reinforcement Learning** (RL) is a field of research on the study of **agents** that can **self-learn** how to behave through feedback, **reinforcement**, from its **environment**. RL is a subfield of **Machine Learning**, which in turn is a subfield of **Artificial Intelligence or Computer Science**. 

RL differs from the more common machine learning task of **Supervised Learning**, wherein one is provided with a labeled dataset and has to infer a function that generalizes well on unseen examples. In RL, one starts without any such dataset and the agent has to obtain data through interaction in order to learn how to behave, and usually one intens to optimize the *accumulated reward over the agent's lifetime*.

For example, let's suppose we have a robot (our agent) that we send to Mars (the environment). We wish it to make a lot of distance and gather some rocks along the way. Although we could try to model the environment, it will require quite some resources and may be somewhat inaccurate. Controlling the robot from Earth is also not a good option, as our instructions will arrive minutes later. Thus, it might be a good idea to make our robot capable of learning by itself.












<!--
I, myself, find RL very interesting as it tackles two main challenges in machine learning:
1. If no model of the problem is available, we can learn t


Thus, RL addresses problems for which one does not have an accurate model as it may have been too costy or simply impossible to get.

For example, a robot on Mars






Throughout the years, various environments, or **problems**, have been considered and developed various algorithms that cultivate agents, or **solutions**.
